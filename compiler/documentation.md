# (Work in Progress) Documentation for `vpex` files:

## Basic Structure
A `vpex` file can be divided into 11 sections, each must be present (can be empty) and must be listed as the exact order as below:

### Usize Flag:
An option line `UFLAG on` at the beginning of the file. If the line is added, we treat all variable as unsigned (`uint32_t`).

### Macro:
Begins with a single line: `PREAMBLE`. Each non-empty line in this section must be of the C macro format:
```
#define <SYM> <VAL>
```
where `<SYM>` is the name of a constant and `<VAL>` is an integer value.

All non-empty lines are copied verbatim to all C files, and all `<SYM>` are converted to integer input variables of the main method in all Viper files.

### Ti &rarr; Te Proof Prefix:
Begins with a single line: `PRE-TiTe`. Every non-empty line in this section is copied verbatim to beginning of the generated Ti &rarr; Te Viper file.

### Te &rarr; Ts Proof Prefix:
Begins with a single line: `PRE-TeTs`. Every non-empty line in this section is copied verbatim to beginning of the generated Te &rarr; Ts Viper file.

### C Helper Functions:
Begins with a single line: `HELPER`. Every non-empty line in this section is copied verbatim to beginning of all generated C files.


### Input Struct:
Begins with a single line: `IN`. Each non-empty line must be one of the three formats:
```
int <SYM>
arr <SYM> <VAL>
mat <SYM> <VAL> <VAL>
```
where `<SYM>` is the name of a variable and `<VAL>` is either an integer value or a constant variable defined in Macro section.
* `int x` refers to an integer variable `x` in `Struct In` of C files and in parameters of the main method in Viper files
* `arr x, n` refers to an array `x` of size `n` in `Struct In` and method parameter
* `mat x, n, m` refers to a 2-D array `x` of size `n` by `m` in `Struct In` and method parameter

### Output Struct:
Begins with a single line: `OUT`. Each non-empty line must also be one of the three formats described in the section above. Variables listed here appear in `Struct Out` of C files and **do not** appear directly in Viper files. However, we require that for any variable listed in this section, **a local variable with an identical name** must be defined in the main function / method.

### Ti &rarr; Te Proof Requirement:
Begins with a single line: `REQ-TiTe`. Every non-empty line in this section is copied verbatim to the beginning of the main method of the generated Ti &rarr; Te Viper File. Each line should be of the form `requires <EXPRESSION>`.

### Te &rarr; Ts Proof Requirement:
Begins with a single line: `REQ-TeTs`. Every non-empty line in this section is copied verbatim to the beginning of the main method of the generated Te &rarr; Ts Viper File. Syntax is the same as in Ti &rarr; Te proof requirement.

### Ti code:
Begins with a single line: `TI`. Content of this section will appear in generated `ti` C file, `exo` file, and front of Ti &rarr; Te Viper file.

Syntax of this section largely follows Syntax & Tokens section, with two special remarks:
* Ghost variables are allowed.
* Assertions are **not** allowed.

### Te code:
Begins with a single line: `TE`. Content of this section will appear in generated `te` C file, end of Ti &rarr; Te Viper file, and front of Te &rarr; Ts Viper file.

Syntax of this section largely follows Syntax & Tokens section, with two special remarks:
* Ghost variables are **not** allowed. (Zach can you check this?)
* Assertions are allowed (and likely required).

### Ts code:
Begins with a single line: `TS`. Content of this section will appear in generated `ts` C file and end of Te &rarr; Ts Viper file.

Syntax of this section largely follows Syntax & Tokens section, with two special remarks:
* Ghost variables are **not** allowed.
* Assertions are allowed (and likely required).

### INP (Zach is this a mark for termination?)

## Line Prefixes
In all of Ti, Exo, Te, and Ts sections, we can add prefixes to lines so that they only appear in certain locations. The prefixes are:
* `%`: The line only appears in relevant Viper files.
* `%c`: The line only appears in relevant C files, including the `exo` file.
* `%exo`: The line only appears in `exo` C file and relevent Viper files.
* `%vie`: The line only appears in Ti &rarr; Te Viper file.
* `%ves`: The line only appears in Te &rarr; Ts Viper file.

Note that adding `%ves` in Ti section would cause the compiler to skip the line. Since contents in Ti section do not appear in Te &rarr; Ts Viper file. Simlarly, `%vie` should not appear in Ts section and `%exo` should not appear in anywhere but Ti section.

## Syntax & Tokens
Syntax of all of Ti, Exo, Te, and Ts sections are based on conventional C format, with the following changes:
* No semicolons at the end of line. No two statements on the same line.

* No brackets (`{`, `}`) for scoping. 

* If / else statements are of the form:
```
if <CONDITION>
    <BODY>
end
```
Note that brackets are not required around the condition.

* For loops are of the form:
```
loop <ITERATOR> <TERMINATOR>
    <BODY>
endloop
```
where `<ITERATOR>` must be a **unique** identifier that has not been defined in the current function, and `<TERMINATOR>` is either an integer value, a constant variable defined in macro section, or a computation that can be statically evaluated **with
no spaces in between**. Loop count will always start from 0.

* While loops are of the form:
```
while <CONDITION>
    <BODY>
end
```
Any while loop should only appear in Ti section and should be proceeded by a **loop bound** statement of the form
```
buffet <BOUND>
```
where `<BOUND>` is pre-determined value (similar to `<TERMINATOR>` in for loop) that states the maximum number of iterations allowed for the while loop.

The only exception is when the while loop appears in a nested loop. In this case, a loop bound statement should appear right
before the outermost loop statement (regardless of while or for loop).

* Variables in `Struct In` and `Struct Out` should be referred as `input->X` and `output->X` respectively, with no spaces in between.

* Array definition is of the form `arr <SYM> <VAL>`, and are accessed using the expression `slot( <SYM>, <VAL> ).val`. Note that a space should always present between elements, and between elements and the brackets, and there needs to be **NO** spaces within an element or between elements and `,` (i.e. `slot( A , k - 1 ).val` is not allowed).

* Matrix definition is of the form `mat <SYM> <VAL> <VAL>`, and are accessed using the expression `mat_slot( <SYM>, <VAL>, <VAL> ).val`. Note that like array accesses, elements and brackets should be separated by a space, and **NO** spaces within an element or between elements and `,`.

* Ghost variables are defined of the form:
```
ghostInt <SYM>
ghostArr <SYM> <VAL>
ghostMat <SYM> <VAL> <VAL>
```
They can only be defined in Ti section, and behave similarly to regular variables, except that they are outputs of exo compute in `te` C file, and their values can be accessed in the `te` section of Ti &rarr; Te Viper file.

* Assertions are of the form `assert_zero <EXPR>`. Note that for the assertion to pass, `<EXPR>` should either be evaluated to 0 or `false`, which means that they are the negation of whatever we are trying to assert.

## Other Rules & Known Bugs
* The right shift operator `>>` must have a space between it and the proceding value / variable. i.e. `>>1` is not allowed, need to use `>> 1`.
* Skipping a line after `assert_zero` seems to result in segmentation fault.
